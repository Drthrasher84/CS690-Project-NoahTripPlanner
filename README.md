# Scenario
## _A Day in the Life of Noah_

### Morning

Noah opens their laptop to finalize plans for an upcoming road trip. The trip has been on the calendar for weeks, but the details still feel a bit scattered. There are hotel reservations saved in an email, notes about restaurants scribbled in a notebook, and a vague list of stops stored on Noah’s phone.

Scrolling through emails, Noah mutters, “Where did I put that confirmation number?” After a few minutes of searching, it turns up—but the process has already eaten into the morning.

### Late Morning

Noah takes a coffee break and opens a map app to double-check the driving route. It seems straightforward, but some of the stops feel a bit out of the way. Noah wonders if there’s a better way to organize everything into a single plan, something that lists the destinations day by day.

A coworker mentions using an online planner for trips, but Noah shakes their head. “I don’t want to sign up for another app. I just need something simple to keep my stops in order.”
 

### Lunch

At lunch, Noah scrolls through restaurant reviews for one of the planned stops. A few options sound promising, but there’s no easy way to save them for later. A napkin becomes the default solution, with a hastily scribbled list of “pizza,” “tacos,” and “coffee.”

Noah laughs at the growing stack of random notes. “This isn’t helping.”

### Afternoon

Noah gets a call from a travel buddy, asking about the itinerary. “When are we supposed to check in at the hotel again?” they ask. Noah flips through papers and opens the notes app on their phone but can’t find the exact time. “I’ll check and text you later,” Noah says, trying not to sound annoyed.

After the call, Noah adds another sticky note to the pile: “Consolidate trip details.”

### Evening

Sitting at the dining table, Noah looks at the scattered notes, emails, and screenshots. There’s a list of stops, some vague restaurant ideas, and hotel details—but it’s all fragmented. The excitement for the trip is turning into stress, but Noah doesn’t have the energy to fix it tonight.
